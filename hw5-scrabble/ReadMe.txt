Hw 5 - Scrabble

I was able to implement most of the features. I split the program into a Model-View, so it has an underlying Data Model that works 100% correctly. You can see a data object readout of that everytime you change something in the console viewer. And this includes JSON objects to store and manage things.

As for the CSS, I was able to get the images cropped + displayed nicely. I have the drag and drop from jQuery working on the programming side, but the behaviour is unexpected. This is the part that is not complete, the tiles sometimes act weirdly on the screen whene dropped.

However the underlying data model updates and a score is tallied that is in line with the data model.
